## How to run it
1/First of all you'll need to install nodeJS (and npm as well).
>To see if nodeJS is already installed : 
```sh
node --version
```

2/ You'll need to install these :
."socket.io"
."expressJS"
//The others are not really necessary.

You just need to (for these depedencies) :
```sh
npm install
```

3/To run the app on your localhost : 

```sh
npm start server.js
```

or if you prefer "nodemon":

```sh
npm run go
```

There you go 😉
